‘Open Source Code’ is your dream destination. It is an open source
platform targeted solely for beginners. From contributing to real life
projects, generating new ideas and approaches, or exploring the world
of open sourcing, everything is at your fingertips now without any hustle.
No need to learn any version control system, such as Git, or how to
resolve merge conflicts. Also, no need to confuse yourself while looking
at any repository. Sounds amazing as well as unbelievable right?

Yes, it’s all true. Here, at ‘Open Source Code’, the contributors can
choose their field of expertise and start contributing accordingly, the
amazing feature which is not present in GitHub. Also, GitHub search
option has limited functionality and gives users a tough time to navigate
through the website and eventually poor User Interface (UI) for its users.

But here, if stuck at anything? Not to panic. At ‘Open Source Code’,
separate channel for mentor-contributor discussion as well as interactive
discussion forums paves your way for the future version of your open
source journey. “Better interactions commit best results” is the tagline we
proudly believe in.
